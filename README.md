# ‚úèÔ∏è Fourier Drawing Visualizer with Epicycles

This project demonstrates how any hand-drawn shape can be reconstructed using **Fourier series** and animated with rotating vectors called **epicycles**. It combines real-time drawing, Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), and visualization using `pygame`.

## üß† Concept

The program lets you draw a shape using your mouse, performs a **DFT** on the coordinates, and then animates the reconstruction using **rotating circles (epicycles)**. This is a visual representation of the Fourier series in action ‚Äî converting a spatial signal into a frequency domain and back.

## üñ•Ô∏è Features

- Mouse-drawing interface
- Computes Fourier coefficients of the drawn path
- Animates rotating vectors to rebuild the drawing
- Smooth trail effect for visualization
