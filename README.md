# Fourier-Drawing-with-Epicycles
ourier Drawing with Epicycles This project visualizes how complex shapes and drawings can be reconstructed using rotating vectors derived from the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). By decomposing hand-drawn paths into circular motions, it demonstrates the power of Fourier series in a visually intuitive way.
